### Final Project -  Simplex Two Steps Solver
This is an open project simplex solver. This project uses python to calculate the optimum of a set of linear constraints
that form a convex polytope. All code uses Simplex in matrix form and the two-phase algorithm.

To use this code, just follow the main code, where we add an instance with its certain restrictions and cost vector.

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run
```bash
pyhton3 Simplex/main.py
```
